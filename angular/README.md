# DevExtreme Angular NumberBox - Getting Started 

This repository stores the source code examples for the Angular NumberBox UI component that displays a numeric value and allows a user to modify it by typing in a value, incrementing or decrementing it using the spin buttons, keyboard or mouse. Read more in the [Getting Started with NumberBox](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/NumberBox/Getting_Started_with_NumberBox/) tutorial.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
